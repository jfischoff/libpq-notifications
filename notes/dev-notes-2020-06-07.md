I would like to be able to write a function like

```haskell
import qualified GHC.Event as E

-- | Trigger and remove all read event callbacks in the 'E.EventManager'
wakeupRead :: PQ.Connection -> IO ()
wakeupRead conn = do
```

That is sort of like `closeFd` and deletes all the read notifications for the fd and calls the callbacks with the read event set.

I can't do this because the needed libraries are private. I'm going to make a feature.
